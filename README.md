Using different Git services with different accounts for each
from one machine can be a pain. This should be used to update
the user configs for Git before a commit to ensure the
accuracy of the commit author.

## To install, source this file from .bashrc

### Still left to do
+ Change from parsed text to JSON file for each user
+ Add more attributes to the User config
+ Add ability to change specific user attributes
